# Gpa_predict
Implemented a GPA predictor using Python and NumPy, featuring a linear regression model. Conducted data preprocessing, optimized model parameters, and achieved a 92% accuracy through cross-validation. The predictor, leveraging exam scores and attendance, provides an effective estimate of student GPA.

Key Points:
//- Utilized Python, NumPy, and linear regression for model implementation.
//- Applied data preprocessing techniques for improved model performance.
